163
=====

App to play a generalized version of 163, which is a variant of 24.

History
------
163 is a variant of 24 played with six cards instead of four, 
and with the target number being (you guessed it!) 163, instead of 24.

At the [SPARC](http://sparc-camp.org/) 2012, a further variant was developed,
in which three cards were delt, and the concatenation of those cards created
the target number (J,Q,K were 11,12,13, so six digit targets were possible).
